React Query is a powerful library for managing server-state in your React applications. It provides a way to fetch and cache data from your API endpoints, as well as handle optimistic updates and stale-while-revalidate strategies.

React Query is built on top of the "React Hooks" API, so it integrates seamlessly with your existing React codebase. It provides a set of hooks, such as useQuery, useMutation, useInfiniteQuery, and more, which allow you to easily manage data fetching, caching, and mutations in your application.

One of the key features of React Query is its ability to automatically handle caching and invalidation of data. It uses a technique called "stale-while-revalidate", which means that when a cached data is stale, React Query will immediately return the cached data to your component, while also triggering a background fetch to update the data. This allows your application to always have up-to-date data without causing unnecessary network requests.

React Query also provides a number of other advanced features, such as polling, pagination, and suspense support. Overall, React Query is a powerful and flexible library that can greatly simplify the management of server-state in your React applications.

Most core web frameworks do not come with an opinionated way of fetching or updating data in a holistic way. Because of this developers end up building either meta-frameworks which encapsulate strict opinions about data-fetching, or they invent their own ways of fetching data. This usually means cobbling together component-based state and side-effects, or using more general purpose state management libraries to store and provide asynchronous data throughout their apps.

server state:

Is persisted remotely in a location you do not control or own
Requires asynchronous APIs for fetching and updating
Implies shared ownership and can be changed by other people without your knowledge
Can potentially become "out of date" in your applications if you're not careful
