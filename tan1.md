React Query is a powerful library that simplifies the management of server-state in your React applications. The fundamentals of React Query include:

QueryClient: The QueryClient is the core component of React Query. It is responsible for managing the cache, fetching data, and handling mutations.

Queries: Queries are functions that fetch data from an API endpoint. React Query provides several query functions, such as useQuery, useInfiniteQuery, and usePaginatedQuery.

Query Keys: Query keys are unique identifiers for queries. They can be any value or array of values that uniquely identify a query. Query keys are used to manage the cache and to reference query results in other parts of your application.

Query Results: Query results are the data returned from a query. They can be in a loading, error, or success state. React Query automatically manages the caching and invalidation of query results, so your application always has up-to-date data.

Mutations: Mutations are functions that modify data on the server. React Query provides a useMutation hook that handles mutations and provides an easy way to handle optimistic updates.

Querying Strategies: React Query provides several querying strategies such as cache-first, cache-and-network, and network-only.

Automatic Retry: React Query automatically retries failed queries, with exponential backoff, until the request succeeds or reaches a maximum number of retries.

Advanced Features: React Query provides advanced features such as polling, pagination, and suspense support.
